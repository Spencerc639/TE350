<!-- 2 things about the semantic html element in the body of the page that indicates the bottom section - it is <footer> not <foot> (though I can totally understand that it would be symmetrical to having a <head> section of the document so why you would think this were the way to do this). A little more documentation on the <head> tag is available at https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp. A little more on the footer is available at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer. So now that you know that <head> is a different kind of html document section (undisplayed "metadata section") than <footer>, you can understand that the </body> - body closer tag has to appear after the footer and before the closing </html> tag. I hope that this makes sense! Use of the html validator at https://validator.w3.org/ would help you to identify issues in real-time. -->
